#  Hi! I’m Yuvraj Singh Pundir  

### *Software Engineering Student *

##  My Journey ->

I didn’t start coding on a powerful laptop or expensive setup.  
I started with a **paper and pencil**, practicing C language during my first semester at *Kurukshetra University*.  
That’s where I first discovered that I truly enjoy solving problems.

Later, I moved to Germany for my studies.  
My first job here was very different from programming —  
I worked for **2 months** in the **Formal-D company at Tesla’s Gigafactory Berlin**, doing warehouse and quality assurance work on car parts.

It was the first time in my life I saw such a massive, advanced factory.  
That place opened my eyes.

Seeing the huge Tesla Gigafactory made me realize:

> **“If I want to work in places like this, I must study hard and become strong in technology.”**

That day changed my motivation completely.

Now I am studying what I truly love.

##  Who I Am Today ->

- I am a **Software Engineering student** at the **University of Europe, Potsdam (Germany)**  
- I am also taking the **Agentic AI Systems & Design** course from **IIT Roorkee**  
- I have learned **C → Python → Java → Git/GitHub**  
- I’m building my foundations step by step  
- I’m openly sharing my learning journey through GitHub

I am not perfect — but I show up every day to get better.
