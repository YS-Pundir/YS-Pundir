#  Hi! I’m Yuvraj Singh Pundir  

### *Software Engineering Student *

##  My Journey ->

I didn’t start coding on a powerful laptop or expensive setup.  
I started with a **paper and pencil**, practicing C language during my first semester at *Kurukshetra University*.  
That’s where I first discovered that I truly enjoy solving problems.

Later, I moved to Germany for my studies.  
My first job here was very different from programming —  
I worked for **2 months** in the **Formal-D company at Tesla’s Gigafactory Berlin**, doing warehouse and quality assurance work on car parts.

It was the first time in my life I saw such a massive, advanced factory.  
That place opened my eyes.

Seeing the huge Tesla Gigafactory made me realize:

> **“If I want to work in places like this, I must study hard and become strong in technology.”**

That day changed my motivation completely.

Now I am studying what I truly love.
